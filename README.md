Based upon the API documented at <a href="https://github.com/SchedulesDirect/JSON-Service/wiki/API-20141201">https://github.com/SchedulesDirect/JSON-Service/wiki/API-20141201</a>

You'll need your own account with your own username & password.

The password is a SHA1 hex representation of your SchedulesDirect password.

To keep it separate from this repository, I've setup an external file for the appSettings.  There's a template in the App.config.
